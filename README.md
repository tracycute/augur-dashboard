Augur Dashboard is a sample project developed as part of a learning assignment on Forage. The goal of this project is to build a dashboard application using essential frameworks to manage and display distributor metrics. The dashboard visualizes important metrics such as the quantity of goods shipped last month, forecasted shipments for the upcoming month, and year-to-date average monthly shipments.

This project serves as a hands-on exercise to understand and implement the key concepts of building a functional and visually engaging dashboard application.

## Key Features

- **Distributor Metrics Display**:
  - Distributor's name.
  - Quantity of goods shipped last month.
  - Forecasted quantity of goods to ship next month.
  - Year-to-date average monthly shipment.

- **Interactive Charts**: 
  - Visual charts displaying shipped quantities, forecasted values, and monthly averages for each distributor.

- **Mock Data**: The application uses mock data for the metrics before integrating with the actual backend.

- **User-friendly Interface**: A clean, aesthetic interface with engaging and dynamic charts.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: The main framework used to build the user interface.
- **Vite**: A development tool that speeds up the build and development process.
